# Important Changes and Configuration Notes

## Docker Configuration Updates (2025-02-04)

### Health Check Improvements
- Extended health check timeouts and retries for key services:
  - SearXNG: 30s interval, 10s timeout, 5 retries, 60s start period
  - Qdrant: 30s interval, 10s timeout, 5 retries, 60s start period
  - OCR Service: 30s interval, 10s timeout, 5 retries, 120s start period
- Switched from `curl` to `wget` for health checks to ensure consistent behavior

### Logging Infrastructure
- Added Loki (v2.9.3) for centralized logging
  - Port: 3100
  - Memory limits: 1GB max, 512MB reserved
  - Basic configuration with filesystem storage
  - Retention period: disabled (unlimited)
  - Ingestion limits: 4MB/s rate, 6MB burst

- Updated Promtail configuration
  - Added dependency on Loki service
  - Memory limits: 512MB max, 256MB reserved
  - Configured to collect logs from:
    - System logs: `/var/log/*.log`
    - Docker logs: `/var/log/docker/*.log`
    - Container logs: `/var/log/containers/*.log`

### SearXNG Rate Limiting
- Updated limiter.toml with new schema:
  - Moved from `botdetection` to `general`

## Health Check Configuration Updates (2025-02-04)

### Docker Health Check Endpoints Updated
- Fixed incorrect health check endpoints for multiple services to ensure proper container health monitoring
- Changes made in `docker-compose.yml`:

1. Qdrant Service:
   - Changed health check endpoint from `/healthz` to `/health`
   - Endpoint: `http://localhost:6333/health`
   - No other health check parameters modified

2. SearXNG Service:
   - Changed health check endpoint from `/healthz` to `/health`
   - Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/health`
   - No other health check parameters modified

3. OCR Service:
   - Updated health check command to use `CMD-SHELL` with explicit exit code
   - Added `|| exit 1` to ensure proper failure detection
   - Increased `start_period` from 120s to 180s to accommodate model downloads
   - Final command: `wget -q --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1`

### Rationale for Changes
- Previous health check endpoints were incorrect, causing false negative health status
- OCR service needed longer startup time due to model downloads
- More explicit health check failure conditions added for OCR service

### Impact
- More reliable container health monitoring
- Reduced false negative health checks
- Better handling of OCR service startup sequence

### Related Components
- Frontend depends on Backend
- Backend depends on:
  - Qdrant (vector store)
  - SearXNG (search service)
  - OCR Service

# OCR Service Configuration Updates - 2024-02-04

## Changes Made
1. Added `/health` endpoint to OCR service main.py

   - Changed container port from 8080 to 8000 to match application port
   - Updated host port mapping from 8082:8080 to 8082:8000
3. Updated health check configuration to use correct internal port (8000)

## Technical Details
- Internal service port standardized to 8000 (matches uvicorn configuration)
- External port remains 8082 for backward compatibility
- Health check endpoint returns simple JSON response: `{"status": "healthy"}`

## Impact
- More reliable health monitoring
- Consistent port configuration across Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Reduced false negative health checks
- Proper service discovery for dependent services

## Docker Layer Analysis
- No additional layers added to image
- No impact on image size
