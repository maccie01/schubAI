- Health check endpoints accessible
- Log aggregation pipeline established
- Container dependencies properly configured

## Resource Monitoring
- Memory usage within specified limits:
  - RAG services: Under 12GB threshold
  - Training processes: Under 8GB threshold
  - Support services: Properly constrained
- CPU utilization balanced across containers
- Health checks optimized for ARM64 architecture

## Docker Optimizations
- Multi-stage builds implemented for M2 Pro
- BuildKit caching effective for rapid restarts
- Resource constraints properly enforced
- Cross-container networking stable
- Volume mounts optimized for performance

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Loki compaction process (scheduled in ~10 minutes)
2. Implement and monitor SearXNG rate limiting
3. Verify Promtail-Loki log delivery
4. Continue monitoring ARM64 performance metrics
5. Evaluate container resource usage patterns

## Notes
- All services successfully migrated to ARM64 containers
- Health checks standardized using curl/wget based on service requirements
- Resource limits aligned with M2 Pro capabilities
- Logging pipeline fully operational
- Container startup order managed through depends_on conditions

## Latest Status Update (2024-02-04 21:00)

### Service Startup Optimization

#### 1. SearXNG Optimization
- **Previous Issues**:
  * Slow startup (180s start period)
  * Inefficient worker configuration
  * Excessive health check intervals

- **Optimizations Applied**:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - SEARXNG_WORKER_CLASS=sync    # Faster initial startup
    - SEARXNG_WORKERS=2            # Limited workers for quicker init
    - SEARXNG_WORKER_TIMEOUT=30    # Reduced timeout
    - INIT_TIMEOUT=30              # Faster initial setup
  healthcheck:
    interval: 15s                  # Reduced from 30s
    timeout: 10s                   # Reduced from 20s
    retries: 3                     # Reduced from 5
    start_period: 60s              # Reduced from 180s
  ```

#### 2. Qdrant Vector Store Optimization
- **Previous Issues**:
  * Long recovery time
  * Suboptimal storage performance
  * Extended health check periods

- **Optimizations Applied**:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - QDRANT_ALLOW_RECOVERY_MODE=true
    - QDRANT_STORAGE__PERFORMANCE__MAX_OPTIMIZATION_THREADS=4
    - QDRANT_STORAGE__PERFORMANCE__MEMMAP_THRESHOLD=10000
  healthcheck:
    interval: 15s                  # Reduced from 30s
    timeout: 10s                   # Reduced from 20s
    retries: 3                     # Reduced from 5
    start_period: 45s              # Reduced from 120s
  ```

#### 3. OCR Service Optimization
- **Previous Issues**:
  * Model downloads on every startup
  * No model caching
  * Long initialization time

- **Optimizations Applied**:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ocr_models_cache:/app/models_cache  # Persistent model storage
  environment:
    - PADDLE_OCR_CACHE_DIR=/app/models_cache
    - PADDLE_OCR_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=30
    - PADDLE_OCR_USE_CACHE=true
    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    - OCR_WORKER_THREADS=2
  healthcheck:
    interval: 15s                  # Reduced from 30s
    timeout: 10s                   # Unchanged
    retries: 3                     # Reduced from 5
    start_period: 60s              # Reduced from 180s
  ```

   - [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for service startup times
   - [ ] Set up alerts for slow startups

2. Further Optimization:
   - [ ] Implement parallel service startup where possible
   - [ ] Optimize Docker layer caching
   - [ ] Consider pre-built images for OCR models

3. Documentation:
